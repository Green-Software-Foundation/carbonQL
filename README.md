# Impact Engine Framework

[Impact Engine Framework](https://greensoftwarefoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~612dd45e45cd76006a84071a/pages/17072136/Opensource+Impact+Engine+Framework) is an [Incubation](https://oc.greensoftware.foundation/project-lifecycle.html#incubation) project from the [Open Source Working Group](https://greensoftwarefoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~612dd45e45cd76006a84071a/pages/852049/Open+Source+Working+Group) in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/).

**IEF** is a framework to **M**odel, **M**easure, si**M**ulate and **M**onitor the environmental impacts of software

Modern applications are composed of many smaller pieces of software (components) running on many different environments, for example, private cloud, public cloud, bare-metal, virtualized, containerized, mobile, laptops, and desktops.

Every environment requires a different model of measurement, and there is no single solution you can use to calculate the environmental impacts for all components on all environments.      

The friction to measuring software emissions isn't that we need to know how, it's that we run software on many things and each thing has several different ways to measure.

Read the [specification and design docs](docs/Impact%20Engine%20Framework.md) to begin.


## Get started

Run `rimpl` using the following command:

```sh
npx ts-node scripts/rimpl.ts --impl <path-to-your-impl-file> --ompl <path-to-output-file>
```
The `rimpl` CLI tool will condifure and run the models defined in your input `yaml` ()`impl`) and return the results as an output `yaml` (`ompl`).

## Video walk-through

Watch this video to learn how toi create and run an `impl`.

## Run tests

To run the complete set of tests simply run

```sh
yarn test
```

To refresh the set of ompls used for validating the output files, run the `scripts/rimpl-test.sh` bash script (for unix only) as follows:

```sh
./scripts/rimpl-test.sh
```

Then run

```sh
yarn test
```
