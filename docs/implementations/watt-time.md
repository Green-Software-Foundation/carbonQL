# WattTime Grid Emissions Model

# Introduction

WattTime technology—based on real-time grid data, cutting-edge algorithms, and machine learning—provides first-of-its-kind insight into your local electricity grid’s marginal emissions rate. [Read More...](https://www.watttime.org/api-documentation/#introduction)


# Scope 

WattTime Model provides a way to calculate emissions for a given time in a specific location. 

The model is based on the WattTime API. The model uses the following inputs:
* location: Location of the software system ({latitude:0.0, longitude:0.0})
* timestamp: Timestamp of the recorded event (2021-01-01T00:00:00Z) RFC3339
* duration: Duration of the recorded event in seconds (3600)
