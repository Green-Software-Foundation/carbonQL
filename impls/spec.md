## Impl specification

The code snippet below defines a generic impl file, demonstrating the expected structure required by the IEF. This basic structure should generalize the any use case, and any model plugins should expect data to arrive in this format.

The `KEYWORD` tag is used to identify fields whose names should not be changed. Fields without the `KEYWORD` tag can have any name withoiut affecting the compatibility of the `impl` with a model plugin.

The `NO-SUBFIELDS`, `N-SUBFIELDS` or `ANY-SUBFILEDS` tags define whether there are restrictions on the subfields that should be present for each field in the spec. `NO-SUBFIELDS` means there should be no additional sub-nesting beneath a field. `N-SUBFIELDS` is used where there is a fixed number of subfields that shoudl be present (with `N` replaced by that number), and `ANY-SUBFIELDS` is useed for fields that can take any number of user-defined subfields without restriction.

```yaml

tags: # [KEYWORD] [ANY-SUBFIELDS] contains sub-fields with any relevant topic tags

    enrichment: # [KEYWORD] [NO-SUBFIELDS] which model to use for enrichment

  component: # [2-SUBFIELDS] an example of a component - can take any name
    config: # [KEYWORD] [ANY-SUBFIELDS] elements under config are common to all children for this graph component
    children:  # [KEYWORD] [ANY-SUBFIELDS] the individual nodes inside this component

          series: # [KEYWORD] [ANY-SUBFIELDS] in here are measurements at specific times - can be any number of these per child
            - timestamp: 2023-07-06T00:00 # [KEYWORD] [NO-SUBFIELDS] time when measurement occurred
              span: 1 # [KEYWORD] [NO-SUBFIELDS] how many of the given time units does each observation represent?
          mapping: # [KEYWORD] [1-SUBFIELD] details for any unit conversions required
            span: # [KEYWORD] [2-SUBFIELDS] maps span of time to real time units
              units: #[KEYWORD] [NO-SUBFIELDS]
              to: # [KEYWORD] [NO-SUBFIELDS]

# ... more children 
```

## Units

Each type of observation has a **default unit** and **default name**. For example, if you observe a CPU utilization, the name of the observation dimension is `CPU`, and the unit is as a `percentage`. The data passed in is expected to be in that format.

| Dimension | Unit                |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| CPU       | Percentage Utilized |
| MEM       | Percentage Full     |
| Disk      | GB                  |
| Duration  | Seconds             |
| Timestamp | ISO Time            |



## TDP coefficient

The TDP coefficient accounts for the non-linear relationhsip between CPU utilization and power. For example, the TDP of a CPU operating at 20% of the max capacity is not equal to `max TDP * 0.2`. Instead, there is a curve that describes the relationship. Four known points on this curve are:

| CPU Utilisation | TDP Coefficient |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 0               | 0.12            |
| 10              | 0.32            |
| 50              | 0.75            |
| 100             | 1.02            |

This is a naive model to convert utilization to energy consumption proposed by Benjamin Davy in this article https://medium.com/teads-engineering/building-an-aws-ec2-carbon-emissions-dataset-3f0fd76c98ac. The TDP coeffcient for any utilization value can be calculated by interpolating these points.


## Power use efficiency (PUE)

PUE values are derived from this [source](https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-footprint/blob/e48c659f6dafc8b783e570053024f28b88aafc79/microsite/docs/Methodology.md#power-usage-effectiveness).

| Cloud provider | Power usage efficiency (PUE) |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| AWS            | 1.135                        |
| GCP            | 1.1                          |
| Azure          | 1.185                        |
