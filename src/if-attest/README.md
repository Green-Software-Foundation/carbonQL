# `if-attest`

`if-attest` allows users to "attest" to a manifest using a cryptographic sugnature and then post that attestation to a public blockchain so it is available forever.

The concept is as follows:

1) User receives a computer manifest file
2) User wants to verify the manifest is correct. If it is, attest to it.
3) `if-attest` runs `if-check` over the given manifest.
4) If `if-check` is sucessful, `if-attest` grabs summary information from the manifest and computes its hash (a string of bytes that can *onlyt* be generated by hashing that precise file)
5) `if-attest` compiles all the manifest information into an attestation object, connects to the chosen blockchain, signs the attestation and sends it in a transaction to store it onchain.
6) Anyone can then look up the attestation to see that some specific attester (e.g. GSF, some trusted auditor) has attested to its validity. 


## Why is an attestation valuable?

Only the holder of the private key can possibly sign with the given signature. Anyone can recover the public key associated with a signature to be sure it was really the named attester who sent the transaction.

## What is actually attested to?

The following information is included in an attestation:

```
'start': the first timestamp captured by the manifest
'end': the last timestamp captured by the manifest
'hash': the unioque keccak256 hash for the manifest file
'if': the IF version used to compute the manifest
'verified': true.false showing that `if-check` returned a success response
'sci': the computes SCI score
'unit': the SCI unit used by the manifest
'energy: the aggregated energy value for the manifest in kWh
'carbon': the aggregated carbon value for the manifest in gCO2eq
'level': the audit level being attested to
```
