# Overview

Impact Framework (IF) aims to make software carbon measurements easy.

IF allows you to calculate the energy and carbon impacts of your software applications withou writing any code. All you have to do is write a simple manifest file, known as an `impl` and IF handles the rest.

The project is entirely open source and composability is a core design principle - we want you to be able to create your own models and plug them in to our framework, or pick from a broad universe of open source models created by others.

## Navigating these docs

The lefthand sidebar contains links to all the information you need to understand Impact Framework. 

You can find specification pages for individual components of the framework in [`specification`](./04-specification/). 

In [`tutorials`](./tutorials) you will find walkthrouhg guides and tutorials explaining how to achieve specific tasks, such as writing an `impl`, running the model and creating new plugins. 

You will find documentation for the individual built-in model implementations in [`models`](./05-models/).
